"""Regression tests for the Timeshift snapshot service (snapshot.py).

Cover the deadline behaviour for ``timeshift --create``: a full rsync
snapshot can legitimately outlive the old 5-minute deadline while still
being produced, so the service must never surface a failure for a
snapshot that actually exists.
